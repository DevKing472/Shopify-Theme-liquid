<h2 align="center">Shopify Theming Kit</h2>

Shopify Theming Kit is a modern development environment for blazing fast Shopify theme development with Liquid, Vue and Tailwind CSS.
This kit provides an easy way to build a custom Shopify theme from scratch. It contains a minimal styled boilerplate as a starting point. Everything is pre-configured and should work out of the box.

<!-- installing (end) -->

<!-- getting started (start) -->
## Getting started

1. Get Shopify api access: [Instructions at Theme Kit Docs](https://shopify.github.io/themekit#get-api-access)

2. Initialize theme on Shopify store with credentials from first step. Either for **dev** or **live** environment (You can define both environments one after another):
```shell
$ npm run shopify:init --password [your-api-password] --store [your-store.myshopify.com] --env [dev or live] --name ['theme name']
```

3. Publish the new theme through Shopify panel: **your-store.myshopify.com/admin/themes**

4. Start developing:
```shell
$ npm run start
$ npm run open:dev # open store url in default browser
```
<!-- getting started (end) -->

<!-- deploying (start) -->
## Deploying

```shell
$ npm run build # bundle js, css and other assets like images/fonts with webpack
$ npm run deploy:live # deploy shopify/ directory
```
<!-- deploying (end) -->

<!-- css preprocessors (start) -->
## CSS preprocessors
> For the most cohesive development experience, it's recommended that you use PostCSS exclusively. [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#using-sass-less-or-stylus)

By default only PostCSS with PreCSS are installed. [PreCSS](https://github.com/jonathantneal/precss) lets you use sass-like markup in css files. If you want to use a preprocessor it's recommended to use `SASS/SCSS`.

### SASS/SCSS
1. Run the following command:

#### npm

```shell
$ npm install sass sass-loader --save-dev
```

#### yarn
```shell
$ yarn add sass sass-loader --dev
```

2. Rename `src/css/main.css` to `src/css/main.scss`

3. Change `import './css/main.css'` to `import './css/main.scss'` in [src/main.js](src/main.js)

<!-- development environment concepts (start) -->
## Development environment concepts

- By running `shopify:init` and entering credentials, the task initializes a new theme from `shopify/` directory to the provided Shopify store. It also saves a configuration file for the specified environment inside `.config/shopify/` directory. This file will be ignored by git and shouldn't be tracked for security reasons. All tasks regarding Shopify will use the credentials from the saved configuration file.
- By running `yarn start` 3 tasks are executed in parallel: `dev`, `reloadr` and `shopify:watch`.
- Inside the `src/` directory are: a tailwind config, scss files and vue related files.
- All vue related files are auto-loaded by webpack with [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#requirecontext) - vue components, vuex modules, mixins with `global` in their filename and directives with `global` in their filename.
- Vue components can be either used as regular single-file-components or as [renderless components](https://css-tricks.com/building-renderless-vue-components) without `<template></template>` tags.
- The webpack bundle and all other assets are outputted to `shopify/assets/` directory.
- The `shopify/` directory is being watched for changes and all changed files are uploaded to the Shopify remote server. After the upload is finished, a request is sent to a `localhost:port` address and the [reloadr script](.config/reloadr/) reloads the remote store (if it's open in the browser and connected via websockets).
<!-- development environment concepts (end) -->

<!-- limitations (start) -->
## Limitations

- When the development task is running, the browser console throws a `bundle.css` error
- Already running Shopify tasks only upload files which are changed, a simple re-save of a file, without editing it, won't upload the file to the remote store
- Vue components inside `.liquid` files can only be used in a non-self-closing `<kebab-case></kebap-case>` manner
- `<style></style>` and `<script></script>` will be removed on mount inside vue components (basically everything inside `<div id="app"></div>`), use `<component is="style"><componet>` and `<component is="script"></componet>` instead
