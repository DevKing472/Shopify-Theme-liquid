<h2 align="center">Shopify Theming Kit</h2>

Shopify Theming Kit is a modern development environment for blazing fast Shopify theme development with Liquid, Vue and Tailwind CSS.
The kit provides an easy way to build a custom Shopify theme from scratch. It contains a minimal styled boilerplate as a starting point. Everything is pre-configured and should work out of the box.

<!-- tasks (end) -->

<!-- development environment (start) -->
## Development environment

- By running `shopify:init` and entering credentials, the task initializes a new theme from `shopify/` directory to the provided Shopify store. It also saves a configuration file for the specified environment inside `.config/shopify/` directory. This file will be ignored by git and shouldn't be tracked for security reasons. All tasks regarding Shopify will use the credentials from the saved configuration file.
- By running `yarn start` 3 tasks are executed in parallel: `dev`, `reloadr` and `shopify:watch`.
- Inside the `src/` directory are: a tailwind config, scss files and vue related files.
- All vue related files are auto-loaded by webpack with [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#requirecontext) - vue components, vuex modules, mixins with `global` in their filename and directives with `global` in their filename.
- Vue components can be either used as regular single-file-components or as [renderless components](https://css-tricks.com/building-renderless-vue-components) without `<template></template>` tags.
- The webpack bundle and all other assets are outputted to `shopify/assets/` directory.
- The `shopify/` directory is being watched for changes and all changed files are uploaded to the Shopify remote server. After the upload is finished, a request is sent to a `localhost:port` address and the [reloadr script](.config/reloadr/) reloads the remote store (if it's open in the browser and connected via websockets).

<!-- limitations (start) -->
## Limitations

- Already running Shopify tasks only upload files which are changed, a simple re-save of a file, without editing it, won't upload the file to the remote store
- Vue components inside `.liquid` files can only be used in a non-self-closing `<kebab-case></kebap-case>` manner
- `<style></style>` will be removed on mount inside vue components (basically everything inside #app), use `<component is="style"><componet>` instead when working with `.liquid` files
